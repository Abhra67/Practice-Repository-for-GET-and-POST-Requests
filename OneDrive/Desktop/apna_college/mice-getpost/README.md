# Practice Repository for GET and POST Requests
This repository contains my practice code for handling GET and POST requests.

This project is a collection of simple applications demonstrating the implementation of GET and POST HTTP requests. These examples focus on how to interact with servers, send data, and retrieve data . It's a great resource for practicing and mastering these essential concepts for backend development.
